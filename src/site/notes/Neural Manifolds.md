But beyond the early[^1] sensory areas and late motor areas we no longer see clear relationships between single-variables and neuronal firing (CITE); we have mixed (CITE), nonlinear (CITE) and dynamic (CITE) relationships between single-neuron firing and experimental variables.

Taking a (spatial) step back, we can adopt Donald Hebb's original notion of [[Neuronal Assemblies\|cell assemblies]]: groups of neurons working together to represent information. 

[^1]: "Early" is a holdover term from when a feed-forward view of neural processing was more prevalent; early means proximal to the sensory organs late means proximal to the motor actuators. The idea of a neural pathway still holds today, but we know the situation is more complex. Still, early and late are good metaphors.
